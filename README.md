# US Traffic Fatalities 
 
### Introduction :

Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) was created in the United States by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to provide an overall measure of highway safety, to help suggest solutions, and to help provide an objective basis to evaluate the effectiveness of motor vehicle safety standards and highway safety programs.

FARS contains data on a census of fatal traffic crashes within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. To be included in FARS, a crash must involve a motor vehicle traveling on a trafficway customarily open to the public and result in the death of a person (occupant of a vehicle or a non-occupant) within 30 days of the crash.

### Insights :
1. Number of accidents steadily increase from 10 am to 8 pm in the night and peak at around 7 pm.
2. Non-juntions and four way intersections are most prone to accidents.
3. 47% of the accidents occured during dayligth.
4. Only 27.5% of the accidents occured were due to drunk drivers. The majority of the accdients occured involved drivers who were sober and  in their senses. 

### Reccomendations:
1. More traffic polic should be deployed on roads, during weekends and evenings as there are higher chances of accidents happening
2. Make rules near a 4 way intersection more clear and find out the reason why more accidents happen at such an intersection
3. Drunk driving accidents happening may,july, august and october - and hence during these months, be more stringent with drunk driving to curb number of drunk driving accidents happening
